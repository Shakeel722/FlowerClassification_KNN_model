This project is the classification problem based on Supervised learning. The algorithm used in this project is K Nearest Neighbors or KNeighborsClasssifier.
This is a multi-class classifiction problem where we are classifying the input to the corresponding flower.
Finally the ML model is converted to the Streamlit app
